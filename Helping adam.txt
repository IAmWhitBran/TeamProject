How to set up your desktop and make sure you have the latest version on it.

Start from scratch
on your desktop delete the existing local folder for the repository
	- I imagine its Documents/GitHub/TeamProject	delete that
navigate back to the GitHub folder
open git shell and type "git clone https://github.com/wolfinstien/TeamProject.git"
this will give you a fresh version of YOUR coopy of the respository
next navigate to the team project folder
	- cd TeamProject
you need to set up the upstream
type "git remote add upstream https://github.com/PixelKnot/TeamProject.git"
now should be done :) not so hard really

Using Git
your end
- before doing any work type "git pull" to make sure you have the latest version of Your repository
- do work make changes etc.
- type "git add -A" to apply all the changes youve made
- type "git commit" to save them, wait for notepad to open and type your comment then alt + F4 and save it
- "git push" will add it to YOUR online repository
If I have made changes to the master (which is quite often)
- "git pull upstream master" will pull my changes to your local clone of your respository (IIRC)
When you are happy that changes you have made can be added to the master
- go to GitHub.com
- find the master respository (my one)
- create a pull request, when I see it I will pull it in.
- NB please do this often with little changes (like one or 2 scripts) as it reduces the amount of merge conlicts at any one time. Also please provide detailed comments so I dont have to keep trying to work out what the changes do.
